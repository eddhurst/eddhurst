ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eddhurst. I imagine stuff.

ðŸŒ± I'm a stone carver, sea shanty fan, and UX engineer working in React. I have a prior background in WordPress, with a smattering of C, Python and a bit of ASM thrown in from some fun side projects.

ðŸŽ· I maintain [smallwords](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smallwords) and co-made [Ultra Speed Words](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=games.blankslate.ultraspeedwords&hl=en&gl=US)

ðŸŒ¯ Fan of burritos, board games, and kayaking.

:postbox: You can reach me on @eddhurst on most platforms, including this one.
