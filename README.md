ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eddhurst. I imagine stuff.

ðŸŒ± I'm a stone carver, sea shanty fan, and UX engineer working on Design Systems, with Design Tokens, React and CSS taking up most of my brain. I have a prior background in WordPress, with a smattering of C, Python and a bit of ASM thrown in from some fun side projects.

ðŸŽ· I maintain the [smallwords](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smallwords) package that retrieves 5 letter words from an optimised tree and co-made [Ultra Speed Words](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=games.blankslate.ultraspeedwords&hl=en&gl=US) available in all good Android Google Play stores.

ðŸŽ² Currently playing with the question of how to make an interactive CSS challenge that helps programmers who already know how to write code to learn CSS from scratch. Follow along at https://cssbynumbers.dev/cssrunner/

ðŸŒ¯ Fan of burritos, board games, and kayaking. This year I set myself the goal to surf, stand up and ride a wave for 10 seconds. It's unclear if I'm being overly optimistic.

:postbox: You can reach me on @eddhurst on most platforms, including this one.
