- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eddhurst. I imagine stuff.

- ðŸŒ± I primarily focus on UX, working as a frontend engineer in React, with a background in WordPress, and a smattering of Python, C and a bit of ASM thrown in for some fun side projects.

- :postbox: You can reach me on @eddhurst on most platforms, including this one.
